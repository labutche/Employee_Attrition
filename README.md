# Predicting Employee Attrition in an Organization

## Project Description
Employee attrition, or turnover, is a significant challenge for many organizations, leading to increased costs, loss of productivity, and reduced employee morale. This project aims to predict which employees are likely to leave the organization by using predictive analytics, enabling HR departments to take proactive measures to retain key employees and reduce turnover rates.

## Files
- `data/`: Directory containing the datasets used in the analysis.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks containing the analysis code.
- `figures/`: Directory containing the generated visualizations.
- `report/`: Directory containing the final white paper and presentation.
- `code/`: Directory containing the code for the visualizations and model.

## How to Run the Code
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Employee-Attrition-Prediction.git`
2. Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory.
3. Run the Jupyter notebooks to reproduce the analysis and generate the visualizations.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.8+
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Key Findings
The analysis revealed that job satisfaction, years at the company, and salary are significant predictors of employee attrition. Employees with lower job satisfaction, fewer years at the company, and lower salaries were more likely to leave. These insights can help organizations develop targeted retention strategies to reduce turnover.

## Recommendations
Based on the findings, it is recommended that HR departments focus on improving job satisfaction and addressing salary concerns to retain valuable employees. Implementing targeted interventions for at-risk employees can further help reduce attrition rates.

## Ethical Considerations
The project addressed several ethical considerations, including ensuring data privacy, mitigating biases in the data and model, and maintaining transparency in the modeling process. Employee data was anonymized, and efforts were made to ensure that the model did not introduce or exacerbate any biases.
